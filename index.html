                    <h2>Chicken</h2>
                <p>In Nashville, Chef Andy Little of Josephine reinvents the traditional whole roasted chicken by embracing an unexpected cooking method. Instead of relying on the oven, he turns to the deep fryer, achieving results that are nothing short of extraordinary. The process begins with a 24-hour brine, followed by an overnight drying period to ensure the chicken achieves maximum crispiness when fried. The entire bird is deep-fried to perfection, resulting in an irresistibly juicy interior wrapped in a golden, crunchy crust.

                    This standout creation, known as the Josephine Whole Chicken for Two, has earned its place as a signature dish on the restaurant's seasonal menu. Served atop a bed of crispy potatoes and kale, and finished with a vibrant grilled onion vinaigrette, the dish masterfully balances flavor and texture. 
                    
                    "This dish pays homage to the agrarian traditions of my upbringing by utilizing the whole animal, while celebrating Southern flavors with the distinct taste of the deep fryer," Chef Little explains. It’s a sophisticated take on comfort food that keeps diners coming back for more.</p>

                    <h2>Beef</h2> 
                    <p>Beef is the meat of cattle (Bos taurus). It is categorized as red meat — a term used for the meat of mammals, which contains higher amounts of iron than chicken or fish. Usually eaten as roasts, ribs, or steaks, beef is also commonly ground or minced. Patties of ground beef are often used in hamburgers..</p>
